Video about how I improved this code after 7 months on YOUTUBE https://youtu.be/OxFIm6XF8XQ

Task: There is a rest method with a list of machines and various data https://api.delitime.ru/api/v1/cars?with=fuel,model (works with and without parameters). You must implement a test application that gets the list of machines and renders them (change of coordinates) on the map (Yandex, Google, mapbox, OSM â€“ does not matter). When you click on the car icon, display a window with information: car id, quantity of gasoline, brand, coordinates. Additional features (such as appearance, menu of the current application Telemobil) will be a plus.

Execution description: the MVC-n architecture was selected. The task was completed without Cocoapods. With a standard map from Apple, using clustering. Converting an address from coordinates.
